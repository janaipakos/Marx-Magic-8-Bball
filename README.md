# Marx-Magic-8-Bball
Collection of tweetable quotes from [*Jacobin*](https://www.jacobinmag.com/) magazine

## Demo site:

[https://marx-magic-8ball.herokuapp.com/](https://marx-magic-8ball.herokuapp.com/)

## How to Use:
- Click the `Marx Me` button to read a randomized quote.
- Click the `Tweet Me` button to tweet the quote.

## Features:

- [**Meteor**](https://github.com/meteor/meteor) for both development and production. Very fun developing with hot reloading.
- [**Autolinker**](https://github.com/gregjacobs/Autolinker.js) to automatically link URLs, Email Addresses, Phone Numbers, Twitter handles, and Hashtags in a given block of text/HTML.

## Motivation

The aim of project is to let users quickly read and tweet takeaways from [*Jacobin*](https://www.jacobinmag.com/) articles. A side effect was the noticeable similarity between every concluding remark. As of now, the repo can be used as a simple generator and tweeter for quotes and content.
